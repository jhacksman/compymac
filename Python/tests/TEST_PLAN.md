# CompyMac Memory System Test Plan

## 1. Core Memory Operations Tests
- [x] Store Operation Tests
  - [x] Basic memory storage with metadata
  - [x] Task-specific memory storage
  - [x] Surprise-based filtering tests
  - [x] Memory chunk management tests

- [x] Retrieve Operation Tests
  - [x] Basic memory retrieval
  - [x] Hybrid retrieval (vector + time-based)
  - [x] Task-specific context retrieval
  - [x] Importance-based filtering

- [ ] Update Operation Tests
  - [ ] Memory content updates
  - [ ] Metadata updates
  - [ ] Context window management

- [ ] Prune Operation Tests

## Success Criteria
1. All core operations complete within 2s
2. Memory system maintains < 30k tokens per agent
3. 100% test coverage for critical paths
4. Zero data loss during normal operation
5. Graceful degradation under load
